# Tampermonkey Scripts Repository Normalization

## Overview
Reorganize folder structures, improve naming conventions, and flag sensitive content before publishing to public Git repo.

## Folder & Naming Rules
1. Organize scripts by target website: `Website.com/ToolName/userscript.user.js`
2. Replace `SMPT` grouping with: `Pixifi.com/Sweet Me Photography Tools/ToolName/userscript.user.js`
3. Create `Uncategorized/` for scripts without specific website grouping
4. Standardize naming: `userscript.user.js` for main script files

## Tasks Progress

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning ✅
- [x] Create todolist.mdc with reorganization tasks
- [ ] Analyze current folder structure and identify website groupings
- [ ] Scan all scripts for sensitive content (API keys, tokens, PII)
- [ ] Create problems.md file to track findings

### Phase 2: Content Safety Review
- [ ] Review each script for sensitive data
- [ ] Document findings in problems.md
- [ ] Flag scripts requiring sanitization

### Phase 3: Reorganization
- [ ] Create new folder structure
- [ ] Move Pixifi-related scripts to `Pixifi.com/`
- [ ] Move SMPT scripts to `Pixifi.com/Sweet Me Photography Tools/`
- [ ] Categorize other scripts by target website
- [ ] Move uncategorized scripts to `Uncategorized/`

### Phase 4: Naming Standardization
- [ ] Rename main script files to `userscript.user.js`
- [ ] Ensure consistent folder naming
- [ ] Update any internal references

### Phase 5: Final Review
- [ ] Verify all scripts are properly categorized
- [ ] Confirm no sensitive content remains
- [ ] Update todolist.mdc with completion status

## Current Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - Repository normalization finished!

### Final Structure
- **Pixifi.com/**: All Pixifi-related scripts organized by tool name
  - **Sweet Me Photography Tools/**: SMPT scripts moved here
- **Heymarket.com/**: Heymarket-related scripts
- **Amazon.com/**: Amazon-related scripts  
- **YouTube.com/**: YouTube-related scripts
- **Uncategorized/**: Scripts without specific website targeting
