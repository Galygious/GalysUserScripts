<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">C</span>OMPUTER NETWORK SECURITY is very complex. New threats from inside and outside networks appear constantly. In response, the security community is constantly developing new products and procedures to defend against threats of the past and unknown threats of the future.</p>
<p class="indent">As companies merge, people lose their jobs, new equipment comes online, and <a id="gloss68" href="30_glossary.xhtml#gloss68"><span class="key_col">business tasks</span></a> change, people do not always do what you expect. Network security configurations that worked well yesterday might not work quite as well tomorrow. In an ever-changing business climate, whom should you trust? Has your trust been violated? How would you even know? Who is attempting to harm your network this time? And why?</p>
<p class="indent">Because of these complex issues, you need to understand the essentials of network security. This chapter will introduce you to the basic elements of network security. Once you have a firm grasp of these fundamentals, you will be well equipped to put effective security measures into practice on your organization’s network.</p>
